# ArcGIS Online Credit Cost Estimator

A lightweight web-based tool to estimate ArcGIS Online credit costs for hosting feature data, tiled imagery, and common GIS file types. This tool is designed for GIS analysts and teams to better understand and manage hosting costs on ArcGIS Online.


## Features
- **Manual Input**: Calculate credit costs for feature hosting (in MB) and tiled imagery hosting (in GB) based on user-provided file sizes.
- **File Upload**: Upload common GIS data files (e.g., `.tif`, `.gdb`, `.csv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`) to calculate credit costs based on file size and type.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instantly see estimated credit costs after entering values or uploading files.
- **Web-Based**: Accessible via any modern web browserâ€”no software installation required.

## Supported File Types
